## Overview
For this we will demonstarte analytical and programming skills by performing and reporting data 
analysis on a world univeristy ranking dataset.

1. Programming skills are demonstrated by a Python jupyter notebook containing 
the data processing.

2. Analytical skills are demonstrated by a writte

## Introduction

The main focus for this analysis is to determine what affects the world univeristy rankings and how does it change through out the years. Are there any attributes that correlate to the world ranking and if there are how are they correlated. We also touched base on how national trends vary over time depending on governmental educational policies/reforms.
