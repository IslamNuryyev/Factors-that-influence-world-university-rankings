    "Having to choose a university after high school is difficult for most students because of the many options available. Everyone wants to get into the best universities in their country or the best countries in the world. The dataset World University Ranking helps us see what factors have the most impact on the university’s ranking which will help us in our future decision making when choosing a university for masters or PhD. It also allows us to see the quality of education and the influence of the institution overall. \n",

    "We found many datasets but some were particularly eye-catching and intriguing. A dataset called Data Science and Stem salaries was one that we found interesting as it pertains to our field. Another interesting dataset was Factors Affecting Campus Placement. As university students it is important to know what factors affect our campus placement. However we chose the World University Ranking dataset as it also had missing values in its data and we think it will be interesting to deal with missing data in our preprocessing. \n",

    "5. Are there different countries that value different qualities more in an institution? What countries (if any) do not align with the world wide trend in terms of the desired qualities?\n",
